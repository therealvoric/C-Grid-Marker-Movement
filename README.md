# Grid-Marker-Movement
This program allows the user to move a marker around a grid using 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' inputs. The grid is displayed on the console and the user's current position is indicated by a '1'. The program terminates when the user enters 'x' as input.

## Installation
Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/therealvoric/C-Grid-Marker-Movement.git)
Compile the code: gcc main.c -o Grid-Marker-Movement

## Usage
The program starts by displaying an 8x8 grid on the console with a marker '1' on the top left corner of the grid.
Use 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' inputs to move the marker up, left, down, and right respectively.
The grid is updated after each movement and the current position of the marker is indicated by a '1'.
To quit the program, enter 'x' as input.
